## Inspiration

There are a multitude of issues people struggle with as a result of not getting a healthy, balanced, diet. 

## What it does

Currently the app is only able to track calories manually and using a bar code scanner. Users enter the amount of servings they have had and the calories consumed is calculated. On the main screen, a log displays past foods and their calorie counts. A total calorie count for the day, for the past hour, or the past week is displayed at the top, along with a percentage showing how much of an average 2000 calorie diet the user has consumed. 


## Accomplishments that we're proud of

This is our first functional mobile app that's more than a tutorial. It involves bringing together many components like data storage, an API, and barcode scanning.

## What we learned

I learnt a lot of things like:
- Practical Flutter
- Managing State
- Using a database in Flutter
- Nutrition and Food APIs

## What's next for apeiron

Because of time constraints, we were only able to implement the calorie tracking system. Given time, other valuable dieting information such as carbohydrates, fat, fiber, and vital minerals will be able to be tracked. Factors that affect needed calories such as height, height, and physical activity levels will be taken into account. Other features such as graphs will be implemented so users can track their improvements at healthy eating.
